Based on the information I've gathered, I now have a good understanding of the project structure and how the frontend and backend are currently set up. Let me provide my analysis and recommendations:

Current Setup Analysis
Monorepo Structure:

The project is currently a monorepo with clear separation between frontend (/client) and backend (/server) code.
Shared code is in the /shared directory (mostly types and schemas).
The frontend is built with React/Vite and the backend with Express.
GitHub Pages Integration:

The project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages with the base path set to "/Saviana/" in the Vite config.
The package.json has scripts for deploying to GitHub Pages using gh-pages library.
The router in the frontend is configured to handle GitHub Pages paths.
API Communication:

The frontend directly calls /api/search endpoints that are served by the Express backend.
Currently, both frontend and backend are served from the same origin in development (port 5000).
Build Configuration:

The build process outputs frontend files to dist/public directory.
The backend is built using esbuild to the dist directory.
The Problem
GitHub Pages only supports static hosting and can't run your backend Express server. You need to separate the frontend deployment to GitHub Pages and the backend deployment to Railway.

Recommended Solution
Here's what I propose based on your requirements:

Keep the monorepo structure in Replit for development:

Continue developing in Replit with the current monorepo structure.
Make commits to GitHub as you do now.
Modify the build process:

Create separate build configurations for frontend and backend.
Set up environment variables to configure the API endpoint URL based on the environment.
Configure the frontend to use an environment variable for the API URL:

Modify the frontend API calls to use an environment-based API URL.
Add configuration to use the Railway backend URL in production.
Update deployment scripts:

Update GitHub Actions or deployment scripts to deploy the frontend to GitHub Pages.
Create a separate workflow for deploying the backend to Railway.
Create separate branches or use branch protection rules:

You could use a branching strategy where changes to frontend/ only trigger the frontend deployment.
And changes to server/ only trigger the backend deployment.
Required Changes
If you'd like to implement this solution, we would need to make the following changes:

Update the frontend API client to use a configured base URL
Add environment variable configuration for development vs. production
Modify the build scripts to create separate frontend and backend builds
Update API request handling to include CORS support for cross-origin requests
Create deployment scripts for Railway (backend)
Would you like me to implement these changes? I would start by modifying the API client to support configuration for different environments, and then add CORS support to the backend.
